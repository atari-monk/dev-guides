### 22

Project:  
I keep starting the projects all over again.  
I can't achieve the level of quality that would allow me to continue them.  
I just discard them and start again.  
Sisyphus.

Git:  
Git Commit is criptografically secured, key is generated even with commit message.  
Unfortunatly this means commit message must be well put togheter.  
It would be nice if code was secure and documentation editable but it is a unit here.  
Therefore it is wise to format commit message with some convention and note it before pushing.
